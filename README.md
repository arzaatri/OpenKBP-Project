# OpenKBP-Project

Two deep neural networks built for the now-closed [Open Knowledge-Based Planning Challenge](https://www.aapm.org/GrandChallenge/OpenKBP/). The GAN was build by myself, while the U-Net was built by my partner.

This repository makes use of open-source code from the RTDosePrediction team's [submission](https://github.com/LSL000UD/RTDosePrediction)
